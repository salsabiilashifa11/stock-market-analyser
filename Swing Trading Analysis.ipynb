    "> This notebook is made as a personal initial analysis on swing trading strategies, potential returns, and risks. The analysis performed will solely focus on the stock prices itself without any consideration of external factors and may involve personal opinions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attempting to make money off the stock market takes on many forms. Some people choose to pursue the route of long term investing on companies they believe will succeed in the future, while some others choose to capitalize on the short term fluctuation of stock prices. Long term investments usually aims to make larger gains in the long run, aiming for returns of possibly more than 30% over a span of perhaps 5, 10, or even 15 years. Long term investing is built on top of a company's value analysis, this means that a person would invest on a company they believe have good value that will continue to improve over the years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's talk about trading. Trading is stretched over a shorter time period than investing, sometimes over a period of a day (day traders) or a little longer of upto weeks (swing traders). In trading, the value or expected value of a company isn't really a key aspect to observe. Instead, daily and weekly price trends become the key metrics to help traders decide what stocks they want to buy, when to buy them, and when to sell them. The gains of a single trade is usually lower than that of investing, but since it takes place over a much shorter period of time, the frequency of achieving the actual gains is usually higher. \n",
    "\n",
    "What makes trading, specifically swing trading intersting to me is that intuitively, small gains of around 4 - 10% happens a lot more often than larger gains. So instead of letting the price of your assets fluctuate up and down over a long period of time until eventually you reach a high gain value, you can take smaller and faster gains, minimize the price drops and build a compounding return from those earlier gains. \n",
